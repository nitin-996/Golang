Certainly! Let's break down how this `for` loop works step by step.

---

### **Given Code:**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    days := []string{"sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday"}

    for d := range days {
        fmt.Println(days[d])
    }
}
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Declare and Initialize Slice:**
   ```go
   days := []string{"sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday"}
   ```
   - This creates a slice named `days` containing 7 elements (strings representing days of the week).

2. **Loop Starts:**
   ```go
   for d := range days {
   ```
   - `range days` returns **only the index** of each element in the slice.
   - The variable `d` stores the **index values** (0 to 6).

3. **Iteration Details:**
   | Iteration | Value of `d` | Equivalent Statement |
   |-----------|--------------|----------------------|
   | 1st       | `0`          | `fmt.Println(days[0])` → prints `"sunday"` |
   | 2nd       | `1`          | `fmt.Println(days[1])` → prints `"monday"` |
   | 3rd       | `2`          | `fmt.Println(days[2])` → prints `"tuesday"` |
   | 4th       | `3`          | `fmt.Println(days[3])` → prints `"wednesday"` |
   | 5th       | `4`          | `fmt.Println(days[4])` → prints `"thursday"` |
   | 6th       | `5`          | `fmt.Println(days[5])` → prints `"friday"` |
   | 7th       | `6`          | `fmt.Println(days[6])` → prints `"saturday"` |

4. **Loop Ends:**
   - Once all elements are iterated over (`d` reaches the last index `6`), the loop stops.

### **Final Output:**
```
sunday
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
```

### **Alternative (More Idiomatic in Go)**
Instead of using the index (`d`), you can directly get the values using `_` (to ignore the index):
```go
for _, day := range days {
    fmt.Println(day) // Directly prints the day name
}
```
This eliminates the need to access `days[d]` explicitly.
